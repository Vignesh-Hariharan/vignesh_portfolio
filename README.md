## Analytics Engineering & Data Architecture

### [Salesforce Opportunity Analytics Pipeline](https://github.com/Vignesh-Hariharan/Salesforce_Analytics_Pipeline)
Engineered an event-driven pipeline to transition from static reporting to active intelligence. The system orchestrates data extraction from Salesforce to Snowflake and employs **Gemini 2.0 Multimodal AI** to analyze generated charts alongside raw metrics. By simulating a human analyst's visual review, it identifies bottlenecks and forecast risks, delivering strategic context directly to Asana and Slack to reduce manual monitoring.

**Tech:** Kestra, Python, Snowflake, Gemini 2.0 (Multimodal), Salesforce & Slack APIs   
**What I did:** Event-driven orchestration, multimodal AI integration, ELT automation, API architecture

### [Multi-Touch Attribution Engine](https://github.com/Vignesh-Hariharan/Projects/tree/main/attribution-analytics)
Built this to understand why marketing teams always argue about which channels actually work. Turns out last-click attribution consistently screws over prospecting channels—so I built a comparison pipeline that shows the real picture across different models.

**Tech:** Python, Snowflake, dbt, Tableau   
**What I did:** Attribution modeling, dimensional modeling, window functions, ETL automation, synthetic data generation

### [Fraud Detection Pipeline](https://github.com/Vignesh-Hariharan/Projects/tree/main/Fraud_detection_pipeline)
Built a full pipeline to catch fraudulent transactions—loaded 1.3M records, created 15 features using dbt, and ran experiments with Snowflake Cortex ML. Interesting finding: simpler models with 6 features beat the complex 18-feature ones.

**Tech:** Python, Snowflake Cortex, dbt, Tableau, Slack   
**What I did:** Feature engineering, ML experimentation, automated predictions and alerts
